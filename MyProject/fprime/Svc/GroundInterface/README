A generic interface to ground that interacts with 3 data passing ports:

 1. Read Callback: (input) called when data is available, if connected
 2. Read Poll: (output) poll-able port for retrieving data, if connected
 3. Write: (output) used to send out data

 Note: it is expected that only one of the read ports is hooked up.
