# Getting Started: Introduction and F´ Terminology

The getting started tutorial is designed to teach new users the basics of F´ usage, instruct existing users on new
command that help in F´ development, and act as the canonical "Hello World" example for F´.

This tutorial walks through the following steps:
1. [Creating an F´ Project](./NewProject.md)
2. [Creating an F´ Hello World Component](./HelloWorld.md)
3. [Integration and Testing With F´ Deployments](./Deployments.md)

Once finished, users should have a good understanding of the basic development mechanics for working with F´ and then
could dive deeper into concepts through the [Math Component Tutorial](../MathComponent/Tutorial.md).
