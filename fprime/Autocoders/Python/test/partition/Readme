This test case builds a passive partition component (originally used as an Arinc653 hub) and
connects serializable ports to typed ports of the Duck active test component.  Messages
are echoed from Duck through Partition to demonstrate sync serialized port calls.

In the future this will be automated.

1. Execute ../../bin/yacgen.py DuckComponentAi.xml
2. Execute ../../bin/yacgen.py Msg1InterfaceAi.xml
3. Execute ../../bin/yacgen.py Msg3InterfaceAi.xml
4. Execute ../../bin/yacgen.py PartitionComponentAi.xml
3. Execute scons
4. Execute ./Top

It should work.
