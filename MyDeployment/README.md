# MyDeployment Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the MyDeployment Application

In order to build the MyDeployment application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd MyDeployment
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the MyDeployment application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd MyDeployment
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the MyDeployment app:
```
cd MyDeployment
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd MyDeployment/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./MyDeployment -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
